# Example Axum project

This is my first ever rust webserver, it is mainly meant for me as a playground to experiment with Axum. This (obviously) means I have no clue what I'm doing, and thus this repo probably contains plenty of mistakes. So please don't use this as a reference on how to use the framework.
